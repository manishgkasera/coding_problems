RotateMatrix

  Given a 2D NxN matrix, visualize it as concentric circles. You have to find the rotated matrix where each element in the circle is rotated by 1 position layer by layer in an alternate clockwise and anticlockwise direction.

  Input Format:

    First line of input contains an integer, N.
    Then follow N lines, each containing N space separated integers. These numbers are the entries of given matrix.

  Output Format:

    Print to output the resultant matrix. Each row has to be printed in a separate line and within each row adjecent numbers should be separated by a space.
    Sample Input:
      4
      2 3 4 5
      1 6 7 8
      4 2 1 9
      5 3 2 4

    Sample Output:
      1 2 3 4
      4 7 1 5
      5 6 2 8
      3 2 4 9
